# Adidas-Sales-Visualization (2020 - 2021)

**Project Overview:**  
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Adidas sales data for the years 2020 and 2021 using Microsoft Power BI. The dataset contained approximately 10,000 rows of pre-cleaned and transformed Excel data. The goal was to derive insights into sales performance across different regions, product categories, and time periods while enhancing my Power BI skills.

**Objective:**  
- To develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that presents key sales insights.  
- To identify sales trends across different time periods.  
- To gain hands-on experience with Power BI's visualization capabilities.

**Data Overview:**  
- Source: Excel dataset (pre-cleaned and transformed)  
- Number of Rows: ~10,000  
- Time Period: 2020 - 2021  
- Key Fields: Product Category, Region, Sales Amount, Date, Quantity Sold, Revenue

**Key Visualizations & Insights:**  
- **Sales Trend Analysis:** Line charts were used to display monthly and yearly sales performance.
- **Regional Sales Performance:** A map visualization helped highlight high-performing regions.
- **Top-Selling Products:** Bar charts and tables displayed the best-selling product categories.
- **Revenue Breakdown:** Pie charts provided a breakdown of revenue across different product categories.

**Challenges & Learnings:**  
- Since this was my first Power BI project, I focused primarily on data visualization without incorporating DAX expressions or additional data transformations.
- I gained a strong foundational understanding of Power BIâ€™s interface and visualization tools.
- The project helped me recognize the potential of DAX for deeper analysis, which I plan to incorporate in future projects.

**Next Steps for Improvement:**  
- Implement DAX measures for advanced calculations such as running totals, YoY comparisons, and profitability metrics.
- Explore data transformation techniques within Power BI to enhance data preparation.
- Work on more complex datasets to further develop my analytical skills.

This project marks my entry into Power BI and serves as a stepping stone for more advanced analytics and business intelligence projects in the future.
